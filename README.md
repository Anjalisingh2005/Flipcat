# FlipCat

## Introduction
Hey there! 👋 I'm Anjali Singh, the developer behind FlipCat. If you're a cat lover like me, you're in for a treat! 🐱 FlipCat is a fun project I created with the sole purpose of combining two things I'm passionate about: coding and cats!

## What is FlipCat?

FlipCat is a clone of [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/) but with only one intention 'It is based on Cats'.

FlipCat is created using the MERN stack i.e. It uses ReactJS for its frontend and NodeJS and Express for its Backend along with MongoDB as its Database.

Like Flipkart, User can SignUp and Login, View different products and add them to the cart and view all the items that has been added to the cart.
